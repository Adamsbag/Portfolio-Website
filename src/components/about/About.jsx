          <p>
          I am a goal oriented cybersecurity and cloud computing professional who graduated with a 4.00 GPA.
          For over 20 year, I have been building, troubleshooting , updating, minimizing cost, and securing 
          resilient systems to sustain workloads of different kind. I work as a cloud engineer at Madina 
          Conception. As I was restarting my career in cybersecurity 3 years ago, I started simultaneously 
          learning cloud computing. Today, I have mastered several AWS services such as IAM, EC2, load balancer
          Route53, S3, ECS/ECR, CI/CD and moreâ€¦ As of now I own an AWS Solution Architect Associate and I am 
          working toward an AWS Devops Associate. In December 2020, I obtained my Associate of Art in Cyber 
          Security & Assurance at Baltimore City Community College. I am currently doing my Bachelor of Science
          in Computer Networks & Cybersecurity at University of Maryland Global Campus.
